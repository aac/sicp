Haven't written LISP in quite a while, so going through SICP in spare moments to grease the wheels again.

I'll be skipping some of the questions (e.g., the complexity analysis questions that don't involve coding).
I've done a lot of complexity analysis (including grad classes). SICP for me is more an opportunity to
work on writing cleaning functional code. The complexity analysis is useful and important, but not my
goal for this.

For my own benefit, the problems I've left incomplete (with the intent to return) are:
1.10
1.12
1.19
